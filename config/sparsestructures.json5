  // tips : a spread factor can be a decimal number (such as 1.5)
  //        a spread factor of 1 means all structure's placement are not modified (useful if you want to use only custom spread factors)
  //        a spread factor above 1 means all structures are rarer
  //        a spread factor below 1 means all structure are more common

    // /!\ if you put the name of a structure, all structures in its set will be modified
    // (example : "minecraft:village_plains" will modify all structures in the "villages" set)

    // tip : you can dump all structure sets in a file by running the custom command /dumpstructuresets
    // tip : the same spread factors rules apply here
